#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
The running time of the various operations in the algorithm are o(1), since they are consecutive statement. #Big (0)
b)
First line is a variable declaration, O(1), the cost of the loop is O(n), the total cost of a while loop, if n is -0, the j would run O(nLogn), the sum declaration is O(1). Which is log time.

c)
The if condition is true only once and is o(n), with the assignment declaration on line 29, the O(n). This is linear time.

## Exercise II

def eggFall(eggs):

<!-- f = [] -->

f = n //2
mid = f
eggs = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
if egg => mid:
egg - 1
elif egg <= mid:
egg = egg

This is a run time complexity.
